## Meeting Items Discussed

### [Review] Show off the progress so far

- Henry screeshared and showed the progress made to the frontend so far
- The frontend app at this stage contains dropdowns as well as buttons to create the dropdowns
- The team agreed that visually, the app is on the right track

### [Discuss] Steps needed towards consolidating the front and backend

- Although the frotnend components are present, the frontend is not connected to the backend at this stage
  - This is due to the backend taking a little longer than expected
    - Chaoyu will work with Qi En to complete the APIs

### [Decide] Next meeting date

- The next meeting will be crucial, as it should be the last meeting (unless an extension is given)
- We will see the final product then with, hopefuly, a fully functional frontend and backend
- We will create presentation materials
- This meeting is planned for December 4, 1 day before the presentation date
