## Meeting Items Discussed

### [Discuss] Assignment 2

- In general, assignment 2 tracked pretty closely with the milestone we intended to complete (milestone 1)
- However, we had trouble, in the early stages of the assignment, in terms of keeping in-line with the milestone
  - In the future, ensure relevant documentation is updated together with code changes if any changes deviate from existing documentation
- The blameless postmortem was made in this meeting and can be acceccesed [here](https://github.com/tqe1999/csc302-skynet/blob/main/documentation/blameless-postmortem-2.md)

### [Decide] Select UI library for frontend

- Due to time constraints, we decided to speed up front end progress by using a third party React component library. Practicing CSS has been a learning goal for us, however due to increasing workloads from other courses, we decided that itâ€™s more appropriate to focus on delivering.
- We have decuded in the [primereact library](https://www.primefaces.org/primereact/setup/) due to Henry's prior experience with it and it's widespread use

### [Decide] Distribute work for next sprint
