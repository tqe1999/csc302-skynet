## Meeting Items Discussed

### [Review] Review the end product over screenshare

- Qi En shared his screen of the end product
- Everything is functioning as it should
- We are happy with the end product and look forward to presenting it in class

### [Discuss] What features were scraped and why

The team reviewed the [documented features list](https://github.com/tqe1999/csc302-skynet/blob/main/documentation/features.md)

Overall, there are 2 features we could not deliver:

- Implement API routes for additional functionalities (stock predictions, etc.).
- Improve frontend styling, implement custom designs and responsiveness.
  - Frontend should be usable on both web and mobile views.

These features were in our last two milestones (milestones 3 and 4) and can be thought of as "strech goals" conceived of early on in the project. The first feature listed would have taken too long to implement; none of us have a strong background in machine learning so stock predictions is way out of our depths. The second feature, in particular the mobile component of it, was not necessary to have as the project is to be run only on a linux machine.

All in all, the absence of these features did not compromise the minimum viable product; the core features of the product are present and we are happy with what we produced with the time allotted.

### [Decide] Delegate work for the presentation slides

- These slides are to be completed by December 8
