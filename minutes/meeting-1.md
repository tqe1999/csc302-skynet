## Meeting Items Discussed

### [Discuss] Discuss the availability, experience, workload, and goals of each team member

* Henry: Availability after 4 p.m every day as he is only taking this course. Experience: frontend/backend with JavaScript mainly, but have only used python in academic settings. Have had coop experience in the industry primarily with JavaScript/react. Goal: learn something new, but with familiar technology so as to not spend too much time learning the techstack; to deliver the product on-time.
* Chaoyu: 5 courses, available W R F, experience in webdev, google cloud. Goal: same as Henry.
* Qi En: 5 courses, available tues and thurs. Experience in full stack, focus on backend, machine learning, devops, and infrastructre

### [Discuss] Data source

* General ideas for now, but will elaborate in the next meeting
* Chaoyu suggested the Toronto crime dataset located at the [Toronto Police Service Public Safety Data Portal](https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/). This data is not live, thus more reliable than an API.
* Henry suggested taking soccer or basketball data to predict which team will win next.
* Qi En suggested using financial data: identifying correlations between stock prices, and correlations between stock market and overall. He says a picture similar to the one below may be generated with the data

### [Discuss] Tech Stack

* **The following is not the final teck stack, it is a preliminary discussion of which software to use and their justifications.  It is by no means final**
* We all want to use familiar technology as per the goals talked about in the first portion of the meeting.  All three of us have experience with **Python**. From our experience using **Python**, **Python** has a wide array of data processing libraries, as well as data visualization libraries (for instance, this library for generating graphs called [plotly](https://dash.plotly.com/) ).
* We are also familiar with **JavaScript**. Henry favors **JavaScript** more. Qi En has more backend experience.
* Based off the above factors, a preliminary idea for the techstack will be the following:
    * Containerization: **Docker** is a strong contender due to its strong adoption rate, strong ecosystem of prebaked images to build upon, highly portability, availability of server-less hosting platforms, and it's lightweight nature compared to VMs like **Vagrant**. Team members are familiar with **Docker**. Docker-compose is a simple multi-container orchestration tool which for our purposes, will be used to run a handful containers on a single host. **Docker** also simplifies installation and setup; a requirement for this project since installation and setup must be performable with a single step. We don't think anything beyond the aforementioned, such as kubernetes, will be necessary for our purposes.
    *  Database: TBD, the data source we pick will guide is towards which one to choose, but here are some that we are familiar with;
        * SQL
            * Postgres
        * NoSQL
            * MongoDB
            * DynamoDB
            * Firestore
            * Redis
    * Backend (API): We decided on **Python** for our entire backend to diversify our codebase, as different team members have varying skill levels on frontend and backend. In terms of API frameworks, Henry only knows **Express.js** which is a **JavaScript** framework. The rest know **Flask/Django** which are **Python** frameworks. Since **Python** is being used for the backend, one of **Flask** or **Django** seems like the natural choice.
        * Testing framework for backend API: TBD, no decision on framework yet.
    * Backend (data pipeline): **Python** since the API server will also use python. This simplifies integration.
        * Testing framework for data pipeline API: TBD, no decision on framework yet.
    * Code formatter: **Black** for **Python** and **Prettier** for **JavaScript**; theses are industry standard code formatters for enforcing code formatting best practices, and are configurable to meet our use cases
    * Frontend: **JavaScript**, see reason for backend (API). We will also be using the **JavaScript** framework **React**.
	    * We want our frontend to have a modern look and feel. This means that the frontend must be dynamic, and not static. Using a framework like **React** is a natural choice.
	    * The question then becomes, why not use other frameworks which can also provide that modern look and feel such as **Angular**?
		* **React** has a strong ecosystem of components, good support (documentation/community discussions). Plus,  We decided not to use other frameworks such as **Angular** since we have less exposure to it. Using **React**, a framework which we are all familiar with, allows us to save the time it takes towards acquiring a new framework and use that time towards development.
        * Testing framework: **Jest**, allows testing and mocking of **React** applications

### [Discuss] Preliminary plan

* Milestones (the first milestone only, the rest TBD):
    * Before assignment 1 submission: decide on data source, finalize choices on database, testing, and frameworks.
* Responsibilities for each milestone:
* Immediate next actions:
    * Setup repository folders
    * Research about data sources and how to integrate them
    * Monitor assignment 1 due date
