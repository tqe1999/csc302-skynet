## What goals have been achieved.
Assignment 1, being the first assignment, involved a lot of documentation.  In terms of this, we achieved all of the documentations necessary for us to have a good idea of what the tech stack is going to look like.  This included documentation for packaging, CI/CD, frontend, backend, and database.  These documentations are then compiled into the [tech-stack.md document](https://github.com/tqe1999/csc302-skynet/blob/main/documentation/tech-stack.md).
 
The roadmap was another form of documentation which was produced.  This gave a rough estimate for what work needs to be done for each stage of the project, as well as a rough partitioning of said work among the group members.  This roadmap is compiled as the [roadmap.md document](https://github.com/tqe1999/csc302-skynet/blob/main/documentation/roadmap.md).
 
Aside from documentation, a toy application was produced.  As a part of this application, we set up the boilerplate code for our frontend app and API.  Additionally, we also completed software packaging using Docker.  We created basic unit tests to ensure that our frontend is built and run correctly.  We have created mock API endpoints that return placeholder names of stocks and a placeholder for the correlation matrix.  We have created tests in pytest for those endpoints to ensure that they are returning data of the correct type and format.
 
## What goals have been missed, and by how much.
We were able to complete the milestone with no goals missed.
 
## How plans will need to be adjusted, based on remaining time available and project scope.
We were able to complete the milestone at a comfortable pace. However, we acknowledge that time constraints are likely to become tighter as academic load from other courses increase. Therefore, we expect that changes to our plans or milestones will be needed in the future.
 
## What, if any, adjustments or decisions need to be made in light of what we have learned about project scope and capacity since. 
We have noticed that estimating the time for development tasks is particularly challenging in the university setting. Since each team member has different course loads and each course has different schedules, the capacities of our team members can fluctuate greatly in short time spans. We should take this into consideration when planning for future development tasks. Specifically, each team member should not only consider the milestone deadlines for CSC302, but also weigh the impact of term tests and due dates from other courses, as well as other non-academic complications. In addition, since individual academic loads may be unpredictable, we should also emphasise flexibility in our planning. For example, important development tasks concerning key features should include back up plans or schedules in case of unexpected delays.
