## What goals have been achieved.
We have set up a database service, and written a script to initialise it with data from our chosen financial data API when the stack is first created.
We have created mock API endpoints that return placeholder names of stocks and a placeholder for the correlation matrix.
We have created tests in pytest for those endpoints to ensure that they are returning data of the correct type and format.
 
## What goals have been missed, and by how much.
We have failed to create an endpoint that returns the actual list of stocks that we have available in our database, as well as the actual correlation matrix. These tasks are relatively simple, and we already have the API endpoint structure and tests laid out for them, so we believe we are quite close to completion. This target was missed because the implementation for the database and data loading script happened more slowly than expected, which resulted in the development of the API endpoints being blocked and delayed.
 
## How plans will need to be adjusted, based on remaining time available and project scope.
In the future, we will need to more clearly identify areas of work that have the potential to block progress in other areas, raising them up to the team as soon as possible instead of waiting for meetings to update. We should then prioritise work there, so that we can continue to work concurrently instead of having to wait for a single bottleneck in development.
 
## What, if any, adjustments or decisions need to be made in light of what we have learned about project scope and capacity since. 
Besides the adjustment above, since we have achieved the majority of the goals set out for the development cycles so far,  we remain confident that we are still on track to achieve the targets set out for the project initially.
